<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/

Parks and Recreation-tribute Turntable.fm bot.

/*<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Requirements
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/

Node.js
NPM
ttapi - https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API
ntwitter (if you want auto tweets) - https://github.com/AvianFlu/ntwitter

/*<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Setup -- THIS IS FROM BOOMBOT (the SwansonBot source code) I DID NOT WRITE THIS SECTION
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>*/


once you have node running, npm,
and the ttapi installed:

Create a FB or twitter account for your new bot.
Log in as the bot and use this to get your bots uid, auth token, and your rooms id:
http://alaingilbert.github.com/Turntable-API/bookmarklet.html
Now use the same method to get your personal accounts user id for control of the bot

Open boombot.js in Sublime text 2 (Or your editor of choice... but really... go get sublime... its great..)
replace the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx's in the variables section with your bots auth, bot id, and your own personal user id. 
replace YourUserName with your own personal username (or whatever else you want the bot to call you) in the variables section.

Add to the arrays and/or commands anything you want to add or change. Would be nice of you to keep the url to obtain your own copy under the /boombot command, but I won't hunt you down if you want it to go.

path to the saved location,
node boombot.js

Notes from the original source code writer:

I know nothing about node. This was a playground that seemed to be liked. No warranties, no guarantees. I will however help you to the best that I can if you have any issues or find any bugs.

If you're more experienced than I am and want to tell me how to make this better in any way. I am all ears. Feel free to fork, if you come up with some cool scripts you can request a pull back and I will add them.

Lastly, ENJOY IT!!!!! It's not the best or most feature filled bot, but I appreciate you using him! 
Come check out my personal bot @TerrorBot on twitter and in http://turntable.fm/while_icode_dropbeatz_infinite_muzik where he lives.
